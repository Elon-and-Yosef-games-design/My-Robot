## Assignment Number 5: Summary of Our Work

Our game is an engaging 2D adventure that features an immersive environment for players to explore. Players can control their characters using keyboard arrow buttons, navigating through a map rich with interactive elements. One such element is a computer object equipped with an integrated collider. When the player interacts with this object, a new scene unfolds above the current one, thanks to Unity's scene-changing mechanism.

One of the defining features of our game is the tracking robot that follows the player throughout their journey. This adds an exciting layer of strategy, pushing players to navigate skillfully while avoiding the robot's relentless pursuit.

The game also boasts an interactive interface where players can write and compile code using our custom-built compiler. This feature adds an educational dimension to the gameplay, blending entertainment with intellectual stimulation. Players can effortlessly return to the main map and continue their exploration by clicking the exit button.

Our game combines the thrill of exploration, the intellectual challenge of programming, and the excitement of evading a tracking robot, offering an engaging experience that both entertains and educates.
