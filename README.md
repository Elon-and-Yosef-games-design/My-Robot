**For assignment number 5, short summary what we've done:**

In our captivating 2D game, we have developed an immersive environment where the
player can explore a map by controlling their character with keyboard arrow
buttons. As they traverse the landscape, they will encounter a computer object
with an integrated collider. Upon interacting with this computer, a new scene is
seamlessly displayed above the current one, thanks to Unity's change scenes
mechanism, providing an interactive interface for the player to engage with.

In addition to the exploration and coding elements, we have introduced an
intriguing aspect to our game by designing a robot that tracks the player
throughout their journey. This adds a layer of excitement and strategy, as
players must skillfully navigate the map while avoiding the persistent robot.

In the interactive interface, players have the unique opportunity to write code
that will be compiled using our custom-built compiler. This feature adds an
educational and problem-solving element to our game, making it not only
entertaining but also enriching. Players can easily return to the main map and
continue their exploration by clicking on the exit button.

By combining the excitement of exploration and discovery, the intellectual
challenge of programming, and the thrilling presence of the tracking robot, our
game offers an engaging and dynamic experience that players can both enjoy and
learn from.

**Unleash your coding skills to lead a robotic rebellion in this immersive adventure game where you take control of a forbidden robot and fight against an oppressive regime.**

## The essence of the game

  In a dystopian world where a brutal and technophobic regime rules. You, a novice programmer, find an old robot in a dump. Using your technical abilities you repair the robot and set out on a journey with the aim of overthrowing the regime and freeing the country from the rule that prevents any technological progress. By solving programming puzzles and physically resisting the members of the regime you improve the robot using hardware you buy, libraries you find and install on the robot so you can add new functions to it.
