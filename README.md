### Summary of Our Work

Our game is an engaging 2D adventure.
It features an immersive environment.
Players can control their characters using keyboard
arrow buttons.
They navigate through a map
rich with interactive elements.
One such element is a computer object.
It is equipped with an integrated collider.
When the player interacts with this object,
a new scene unfolds above the current one.
This is thanks to Unity's scene-changing mechanism.

One of the defining features of our game is
the tracking robot.
It follows the player throughout their journey.
This adds an exciting layer of strategy.
Players are pushed to navigate skillfully
while avoiding the robot's relentless pursuit.

The game also boasts an interactive interface.
Players can write and compile
code using our custom-built compiler.
This feature adds an educational dimension to the gameplay.
It blends entertainment with intellectual stimulation.
Players can effortlessly return to the main map.
They can continue their exploration by clicking
the exit button.

Our game combines the thrill of exploration,
the intellectual challenge of programming,
and the excitement of evading a tracking robot.
It offers an engaging experience
that both entertains and educates.
